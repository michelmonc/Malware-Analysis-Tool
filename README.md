# Malware-Analysis-Tool
This tool will allow users to analyze and dissect malware samples to understand their behavior and threat indicators. It will include functionalities for static and dynamic analysis of malware files. Still in process

**Key Features:**
File Upload: Allow users to upload malware samples (e.g., executable files) for analysis.

----------- **Steps** -----------


**Static Analysis:**
-Extract file metadata (e.g., file size, file type).
-Calculate file hashes (MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256).
-Scan the file with an antivirus engine (using an API or a local database of signatures).

**-Dynamic Analysis:**
-Run the malware in a controlled environment (sandbox).
-Monitor and log system activities, such as file system changes, network traffic, and registry modifications.
-Analyze the behavior of the malware to identify any suspicious or malicious actions.

**Report Generation:**
--Generate a comprehensive report summarizing the findings from both static and dynamic analysis.
--Include details about the file, hash values, scan results, and behavioral analysis results.
--Tools and Technologies:

**Python for scripting and backend.**
-Web framework (e.g., Flask or Django) for building a user interface.
-Virtualization technology (e.g., VirtualBox) for creating a controlled environment.
-Antivirus APIs or databases for scanning malware samples.
-Sysinternals Suite or similar tools for dynamic analysis.
-SQLite or a NoSQL database for storing and retrieving analysis data.

**Considerations:**
-Ensure proper security measures to contain and isolate malware during dynamic analysis to prevent it from infecting the host system.
-Implement user authentication and authorization to restrict access to the tool.
-Keep the tool offline or in a restricted environment to prevent accidental or intentional distribution of malware samples.
-Keep the tool up-to-date with the latest malware analysis techniques and threat intelligence feeds.
